# What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson's disease affects mobility, causes tremors and stiffness, and is a progressive illness of the central nervous system. It comprises five phases and affects more than 1 million people in India each year. There is currently no treatment for this chronic condition. It is a neurodegenerative condition that affects brain cells that make dopamine.

# What is XGBoost?

A new machine learning method called XGBoost was created with performance and speed in mind. Extreme Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, is a decision tree-based algorithm. The XGBClassifier, an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification, will be imported into this project from the xgboost library.

# Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost

In this Python machine learning project, we'll create a model using an XGBClassifier utilising the Python packages scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost. After loading the data, obtaining the features and labels, scaling the features, splitting the dataset, and creating an XGBClassifier, we will determine the model's correctness.
